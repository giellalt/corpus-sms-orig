Intro

"spoken" is a new dir, created for (transcribed) spoken language data stored at freecorpus by the Freiburg based language documentation projects.

Naming this dir "spoken" is only a preliminary convention, because in GT prefers to make a genre distiction.

For more info see the readme file under ../sjd/spoken.
